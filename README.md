## Who I am

 :wave:
Hello there, my name is Miklos Kiss and I'm from Hungary.
I'm learning Electrical Enginnering at the [University of Obuda](https://uni-obuda.hu/main-page/), Budapest. While I'm doing my Masters' degree, I'm also working as a Software Engineer at [Accenture Hungary](https://www.accenture.com/hu-en/about/company/hungary?gclid=CjwKCAjwpqCZBhAbEiwAa7pXebp8RlcSCwvyJqjOAiN5i0n0JTtnvJ7ceO4tX9FjED3ks3q57X0qtBoCqb8QAvD_BwE). I was also the Founder of [OE Spacenetiq](https://www.spacenetiq.eu/).

## What am I doing

  :computer: **At work:** Some **coding** in .NET and C# and solving problems. :wrench:

  :school_satchel: **At University:** Learning about **Electrical Engineering Principles** and **Embedded Softwares**. :books:

  :books: **Books:** My favourites are **sci-fi** like Star Wars and **fantasies** like Game of Thrones and **Tolkien**. Damn, I must be a nerd :frowning: But I read not just fictions, I have dozens of books about aerospace, engineering, electrics and electronics design, space, and physics. :rocket: :milky_way: :telescope:

## What I'm Learning

:books: **Currently:** I'm learning **C#** and **.NET**. Besides this, I'm trying to learn some **python** too, because that is a universal tool for Data Engineering and Data Science and modelling different systems and physics problem. :books:

:books: **In the future:** I'm planning to learn **Javascript** , **Svelte** and **Node.JS**. So basically I can become a Full Stack Developer after. :books:

## What I want to Do

- **Open-Source Projects**: I want to participate in some open-source projects. If it is related to some kind of science stuff, count me in :mag:

- **Contribute:** I want to contribute to the open-source community. I want to help people with their problems and I want to help them to solve their problems, while I can grow myself. :mag:

- **Learn more about Physics**: I want to learn more about physics and the laws of physics. I want to know more about the universe and the planets. :milky_way:
